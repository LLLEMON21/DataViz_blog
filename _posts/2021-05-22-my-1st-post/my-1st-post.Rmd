*Figure 2: Sketch of proposed design*

## 3.2 Desigh ideas

First of all, bar chart shows the absolute numbers of trading volumes in 2019 and 2020 for the six countries which provide the whole picture of the trading performance; then use pyramid chart to give the detailed export and import performance of six countries over two years. 

# 4) Data visualisation steps
## 4.1 Data preparation
**1. Remove unnecessary rows and columns for sheet T1**

Delete  rows 1-5 and 127-140 and filter targeted rows, which are six targeted countries; Keep columns which are targeted time period, 2019 and 2020.

![](image/4.1.1.jpg)
*Figure 3: Remove unnecessary rows and columns*

**2. Do the same steps for sheet T2**
**3. Combine sheets T1 and T2** 

Combine two sheets together, add one more column “Import/Export” to differentiate and rename the country names for concise purpose.
![](image/4.1.3.jpg)
*Figure 4: Combine two sheets*

**4. Pivot data**

Import file into Tableau, select all the years, right click and select “Pivot”.

**5. Rename headers and change data type for columns**

Rename ‘Variables’ to ‘Country’ and change data type to geographic role - country. Rename ‘Pivot Field Names’ to ‘Date’ and change data type to date. Rename ‘Pivot Field Values’ to ‘Trade Value’.
